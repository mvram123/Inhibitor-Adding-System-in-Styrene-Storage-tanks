# Inhibitor Adding System In Styrene Storage Tanks

> Tinkercad Simulation Circuit for this IOT project :- [Inhibitor Adding System](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dovHE7qcp0i-inhibitor-adding-system/editel)


## Abstract Of Our Project

Due to human negligence and many other reasons, many  industrial mishaps are happening across the globe in recent years. One of the main reasons for mishaps are due  to polymerisation reactions, which is an exothermic  reaction. Due to this exothermic nature, lots of heat will release during reaction, this heat leads to many thermal runaways hazards.

Thermal runaway occurs in situations where an  increase in temperature changes the conditions in a way  that causes a further increase in temperature, often leading to a destructive result. It is a kind of  uncontrolled positive feedback.

One of the recent industrial hazards happened in India at  LG polymer chemical plant which is located in Visakhapatnam at Andhra Pradesh.

## Objective Of Our Project

To control and to prevent this type of thermally unstable  reactions we need to continuously monitor the inhibitor level present in styrene and the temperature , the pressure of styrene tank.

Due to the manual methods of adding inhibitor and  monitoring the temperature and pressure, we cant effectively  monitor the styrene present in the storage tank.Based on some chemical plant papers and their  manuals ,this type of method is being used by many  industries across the world including India.

We are using advancement in technology and the IOT concepts to solve this issue. with the help of the IOT we can able to monitor every each detail in the storage tank continuously we can also able to analyse the data received using this system for prevention of thermal runaways, tank ruptures etc.

By monitoring the temperature rise in the tank and the inhibitor content of the tank there is a chance of almost **90%** to stop these type of thermal runaways, tank ruptures and gas leak.

## What If We Exposes To Styrene Gas ?

- Acute ( short-term ) exposure to styrene in humans results in mucous membrane irritation and eye irritation, and gastrointestinal effects.
- Chronic ( long-term ) exposure to styrene in human beings leads to serious multiple complications. Studies on its impact are inconclusive on the reproductive and developmental effects of styrene.
- Several epidemiological studies suggest there may be an association between styrene exposure and an increased risk of leukaemia and lymphoma.
- When it comes in contact with skin and mucosal membranes, its effects include blistering and irritation Many victims also reported a burning sensation in their eyes and a few complained of loss of vision.
- The gas also irritates the nose and throat, causes shortness of breath and chemical inflammation of the lung tissues. Exposure to deadly quantities of the gas can cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs and kill the person.

## When People Should Evacuate ?

- When the temperature of styrene storage tank is beyond **65°C**.
- When there is a temperature rise greater than **2 or 3 °C** per day.
- When the level of inhibitor in storage tank is less than **10 ppm**.
- When the percentage of dissolved oxygen in storage tank is less than **3 to 8 %**.
- When the level of styrene in storage tank is less than **certain range** (Depends on the height).
